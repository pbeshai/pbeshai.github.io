title: Visualizing the spread of true and false news on social media

excerpt: This cover depicts the breadth and depth of the spread of two different news stories through Twitter. The larger orange object (or cascade) represents a false news story, whereas the teal one represents a true news story. I aimed to illustrate the stark differences in how broadly and deeply false news spreads compared with true news, which are reflected in the relative size and complexity of the cascades.
