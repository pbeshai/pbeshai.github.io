excerpt: In late June, Deb Roy approached me to ask if I would be interested in doing some visualization work for a presentation he’d be giving at Twitter’s all-hands event with Bridgit Mendler. The talk was to be about toxicity in Twitter conversations, and would showcase the conversation analysis work being done in the lab, particularly around classifying replies as toxic or not.
